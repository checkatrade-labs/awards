# Progress: Checkatrade Awards Nomination System

## Project Status: Early Development

We have progressed from the initialization phase to early development. We've successfully set up the Next.js project, created the database schema, and implemented key components of the nomination form. The focus has been on creating a user-friendly, multi-step form with AI-assisted nomination quality feedback.

## Key Implementations

### Form Components
- Multi-step form with progress tracking
- Progressive enhancement with optional fields
- Real-time AI feedback on nomination quality
- Enhanced trade search with Checkatrade API integration and logo display
- Detailed trade profile information display
- Flexible award category selection
- Image upload with client-side validation

### AI Integration
- Justification quality analysis with specific feedback
- Criteria-based scoring (trust, quality, reliability)
- Development mode with mock responses
- Idle-triggered and explicit check options
- Fallback mechanisms for error handling

### Data Modeling
- Comprehensive Prisma schema for all entities
- Support for optional and required fields
- Regional categorization structure
- Handling of member and non-member nominations

## Known Issues

- OpenAI API integration requires an API key for production use
- Need to implement proper environment configuration
- Need to complete backend API implementation for form submission
- Image storage requires GCP setup
- Need proper error handling for API failures

## Next Development Focus

1. Complete form validation and submission
2. Implement backend API endpoints
3. Set up database connection
4. Configure image storage
5. Create basic admin views for nomination management

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Project Initialization | March 2025 | Completed |
| Working Nomination Form | March 2025 | Partially Completed |
| Backend Processing | April 2025 | Not Started |
