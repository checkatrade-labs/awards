# Active Context: Checkatrade Awards Nomination System

## Current Focus
We have made significant progress on the initial prototype of the Checkatrade Awards Nomination System. We've successfully implemented the core components of the nomination form with AI-assisted feedback features. Our focus is now on refining these components, enhancing the user experience, and preparing for backend integration.

## Recent Improvements

### Enhanced Trade Search and Selection
- Added logo display in the trade search autocomplete results
- Implemented detailed trade profile information display when a trade is selected
- Added additional trade details including:
  - Company type and owner information
  - Rating display (if available)
  - Categories and skills
  - Company description (with HTML tags stripped)
- Added direct link to the trade's Checkatrade profile page
- Improved the visual presentation of selected trades with a more comprehensive information display
- Verified FormSummary component correctly displays all form fields

## Recent Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for hosting and storage
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o for text analysis and feedback
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form for form state and validation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with max-lines rule (200 lines) to enforce component size limits

### Architecture Approach
- Multi-step form with progressive enhancement (simple by default, detailed by choice)
- AI-assisted feedback that triggers on 15-second idle or explicit request
- Fallback mock responses when OpenAI API key is unavailable
- Integration with Checkatrade's public API for trade validation and autocomplete
- Support for photo uploads with client-side validation

## Current Tasks

### Nomination Form Development
- [x] Set up Next.js project structure
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for data models
- [x] Implement React Hook Form for form management
- [x] Create trade search component with Checkatrade API autocomplete
- [x] Build award category selection component
- [x] Develop justification text field with AI feedback
- [x] Implement image upload functionality with client-side validation
- [x] Create optional sections for additional details
- [x] Implement multi-step form navigation
- [ ] Add form validation and error handling
- [ ] Connect form submission to backend API

### AI Integration
- [x] Set up OpenAI API integration
- [x] Develop text analysis service for nomination quality assessment
- [x] Implement feedback mechanism for improving nomination quality
- [x] Create scoring algorithm based on judging criteria (trust, quality, reliability)
- [x] Add fallback mock responses when OpenAI API is unavailable
- [ ] Implement nomination duplicate detection
- [ ] Add client-side caching to minimize API calls

### Backend Development
- [x] Set up database schema with Prisma
- [ ] Connect to PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Create API endpoints for nomination submission and retrieval
- [ ] Implement trade validation using Checkatrade API
- [ ] Develop authentication for admin access
- [ ] Create endpoints for image upload and storage

## Design Decisions

### Form Design
- Multi-step form to reduce cognitive load and improve UX
- Progressive enhancement with "Add More Details" option for optional fields
- Real-time AI feedback on nomination quality with specific improvement suggestions
- Support for both Checkatrade member search and manual entry for non-members
- Visual quality indicators with specific improvement suggestions
- Mobile-responsive design with accessible form controls

### AI Implementation
- Idle-timer based analysis (15 seconds of no typing)
- Explicit "Check Quality" button for immediate feedback
- Scoring against trust, quality, and reliability criteria
- Fallback mock responses for development without API key
- Client-side validation before sending to AI
- Balance between immediate feedback and non-intrusive UX

### Data Model
- Well-structured schema for nominations, nominees, nominators, and media
- Support for regional awards categorization
- Flexibility for both member and non-member nominations
- Handling of self-nominations with category restrictions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement nomination submission functionality
2. Set up backend API endpoints
3. Connect to PostgreSQL database
4. Implement form validation and error handling
5. Add feedback message after successful form submission
6. Create admin views for nomination management

### Short-term Goals
- Develop a working end-to-end prototype with database storage
- Create a simple admin interface for reviewing nominations
- Test the system with sample nominations from previous years
- Gather feedback on the prototype and refine the approach
- Implement automated tests for key components

### Medium-term Goals
- Implement the full nomination processing pipeline
- Develop the admin dashboard with filtering, sorting, and batch operations
- Set up the shortlisting functionality with manual override capabilities
- Implement regional categorization for the 2025 event structure
- Develop reporting and export functionality for judges

## Implementation Notes
- OpenAI integration includes fallback mock responses for development
- Using React Hook Form for state management and validation
- Progressive enhancement implemented via optional field sections
- AI feedback operates on both idle timer and explicit check
- Form navigation preserves state between steps
- Award categories filter based on relationship (self-nomination)
