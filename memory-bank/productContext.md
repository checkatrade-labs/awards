# Product Context: Checkatrade Awards Nomination System

## Background
The Checkatrade Awards is an annual event that recognizes excellence among trade professionals who are members of the Checkatrade platform. The awards celebrate outstanding service, quality, and reliability in various trade categories. Last year featured 11 award categories, with some being consumer-only nominations and others allowing self-nominations from trades.

## Current Process and Challenges

### Nomination Collection
- Currently uses Google Forms for collecting nominations
- Last year received approximately 1,200 nominations
- Manual review process is time-consuming and labor-intensive
- No validation of nominee eligibility during submission
- No ability to capture photos due to Google Forms limitations
- Form was implemented with a short timeline (about two months)

### Processing Challenges
- Manual review of all 1,200 nominations
- Manual sorting and filtering by company name to identify multiple nominations (using Excel filters)
- Manual assessment of nomination quality
- Manual verification of Checkatrade membership
- Filtering out low-quality submissions (e.g., "He's amazing" without substantive content)
- Manual grouping by award category
- Time-consuming shortlisting process

### Judging Process
- Nominations are assessed against predefined criteria (trust, quality, reliability)
- Manual identification of strong nominations that align with criteria
- Volume of nominations is a significant factor (one trade with 100 nominations was automatically shortlisted)
- Time-consuming shortlisting process

### Scale Concerns for 2025
- Expanding to four regional events plus a national finale
- Expected significant increase in nomination volume
- New requirement to capture images for better storytelling at awards nights
- Current manual process will not scale effectively
